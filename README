Overview
This project consists of a single file, index.html, which combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
create an augmented reality (AR) tool. The tool has gone through multiple iterations, and the
final version is embedded in a Wix page for seamless user interaction.

The purpose of the AR tool is to showcase models of Hawaiian gardens and is being used to support
a local initiative focused on the protection and preservation of Hawaii's ecosystems. The tool
includes a landing page, a menu page, and a viewer page to facilitate the user experience. There
are embedded buttons that allow users to switch between different models. When accessed on a
mobile device, the AR models can be placed within your own space for an immersive experience.

This code was developed for Protect & Preserve Hawai ªi, a nonprofit organization dedicated to
ecosystem conservation.

Features
- Landing Page: The first page users will see, introducing the tool and its purpose.
- Menu Page: Allows users to navigate through different Hawaiian garden models.
- Viewer Page: Displays the selected model, with the ability to place it in your environment
  when using a mobile device.

Usage
The code is designed to be embedded in a Wix page for easy integration. When viewed on a
compatible device, users can interact with and explore different garden models in augmented
reality.

Access
This repo is publicly available for non-commercial usage. You can find more information regarding
